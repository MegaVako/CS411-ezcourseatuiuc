What changes are afoot today in workplaces, civic life and everyday community life? What are their implications for education? What are the possible impacts of contemporary social transformations on teaching and learning - including in the areas of technology, media, globalization, diversity, changing forms of work in the ""knowledge society"", and, in these contexts, changing learner needs and sensibilities? This course explores three pedagogical paradigms: ""didactic"", ""authentic"" and ""transformative"" learning.
